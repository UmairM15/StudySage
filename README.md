Hello Everyone !!! Welcome to StudySage, this is a student activity app made entirely in Turning in 40 hours!!

We chose Turing as the language of our choice because (we are masochists) we wanted to challenge ourselves by using an outdated language so we could focus on our fundamental programming skills.

## Inspiration
We used Turing because wanted to challenge ourselves by using a dated language without many resources so that we could practice our fundamental programming skills.

## What it does
StudySage is a very simplistic student organizer that allows you to create, view and delete notes, create an agenda of tasks, and an interactive calendar.

## How we built it
We decided to split each of the 3 main features amongst ourselves, we each made separate Turing files and programmed our parts and in the end, we merged all together.

## Challenges we ran into
Since Turing is a somewhat outdated and unpopular language it was very difficult to find resources and tutorials for our project. This made programming and troubleshooting quite difficult but in the end, it made us better programmers.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making a finished product that is actually useful in Turing and being able to merge all of our separate files and features smoothly together in only two days is something we are very proud of!!

## What we learned
We learned how to use Turing for higher-level things such as editing and creating files or importing data etc. However we also improved our fundamental programming skills which is definitely going to help us even when we use other languages and in our future projects and hackathons.

## What's next for StudySage
This version of StudySage was mostly a proof of concept of being able to create intricate projects in Turing, however, in the future, we might one day make StudySage into a real thing once we have improved our programming skills a bit more. (Tho we are definitely not using Turing again we are not that masochistic)
